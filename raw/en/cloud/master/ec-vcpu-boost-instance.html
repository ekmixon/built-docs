<p>You can boost your instance with additional vCPU credits: See what they are and how you can earn them.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_vcpu_credits"></a>vCPU credits<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/saas/ec-monitoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html" title="Glossary">vCPUs</a> credits enable a smaller instance to perform as if it were assigned the vCPU resources of a larger instance, but only for a limited time. vCPU credits are available only on smaller instances up to and including 8 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>vCPU credits persist through cluster restarts, but they are tied to your existing instance nodes. Operations that create new instance nodes will lose existing vCPU credits. This happens when you resize your instance, or if Elastic performs system maintenance on your nodes.</p>

<p>Based on the instance configuration size, the vCPU resources assigned to your instance can be boosted to improve performance temporarily, by using vCPU credits. The vCPU ratio values are dependent on the hardware profile selected. The ratios can be found on the <a class="xref" href="ec-default-provider-configurations.html" title="Elasticsearch Service default provider instance configurations">Elasticsearch Service default provider instance configurations</a> page.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Instance sizes up to and including 8 GB of RAM get boosted. The boosted vCPU value is <code class="literal">16 * vCPU</code> ratio, which gets applied to the instance as long as vCPU credits remain. If an instance is eligible for boosting, the Elastic Cloud console will display <span class="strong strong"><strong>Up to 2.21 vCPU</strong></span>, depending on the hardware profile selected.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Instance sizes bigger than 8 GB of RAM do not get boosted, but do receive an additional increase. The vCPU value is displayed in the Elastic Cloud console, which is calculated as follows: <code class="literal">RAM size * 1.2 * vCPU Ratio</code>.

<p>When you initially create an instance, you receive a credit of 60 seconds worth of vCPU time. You can accumulate additional credits when your vCPU usage is less than what your instance is assigned. At most, you can accumulate one hour worth of additional vCPU time per GB of RAM for your instance.</p>
<p>For example: An instance with 4 GB of RAM, can at most accumulate four hours worth of additional vCPU time and can consume all of these vCPU credits within four hours when loaded heavily with requests.</p>
<p>If you observe declining performance on a smaller instance over time, you might have depleted your vCPU credits. In this case, increase the size of your cluster to handle the workload with consistent performance.</p>

<p>While Elastic  recommends always using SSL/HTTPS, not all clients support HTTPS. Also, some clients have poor support, because they do not actually verify the certificate, for example.</p>
<p>To work around this, you can use a proxy or a tunnel. The application without HTTPS support can connect to a local endpoint using HTTP, which in turn connects to an Elasticsearch Service deployment using HTTPS.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_tunneling_with_stunnel"></a>Tunneling With stunnel<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/saas/stunneling-for-ssl.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.stunnel.org/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">stunnel</a> is tool that can be used to provide secure encrypted connections for clients or servers that do not speak TLS or SSL natively.</p>
<p>We can use stunnel to bind to a port on localhost (e.g., 19200), which in turn will connect to Elasticsearch Service.</p>
<p>Here is a sample configuration to achieve this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-ini">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-ini">; Actually verify the certificate
verify = 2
; Works for Ubuntu. Adapt to your system.
CApath = /etc/ssl/certs

pid = /var/run/stunnel4/found-us-east-1.pid

; Log level. WARN=4, DEBUG=7
debug = 4

[foundcluster]
; Service that tunnels traffic to a single region's endpoint. This configuration is not cluster specific.
accept = 19200
client = yes
; Don't cache DNS. IPs of {n}'s load balancers may change.
delay = yes
; Replace us-east-1 with your region. Valid hosts:
; - proxy-v1-us-east-1.foundcluster.com
; - proxy-v1-us-west-1.foundcluster.com
; - proxy-v1-eu-west-1.foundcluster.com
; - proxy-v1-sa-east-1.foundcluster.com
; - proxy-v1-ap-northeast-1.foundcluster.com
; - proxy-v1-ap-southeast-1.foundcluster.com

connect = proxy-v1-us-east-1.foundcluster.com:9243</pre>
</div>
<p>To use this with Ubuntu:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Install the <code class="literal">stunnel4</code>-package, e.g. <code class="literal">apt-get install stunnel4</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Put the above file in <code class="literal">/etc/stunnel/found-us-east-1.conf</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Make sure <code class="literal">/etc/default/stunnel4</code> contains <code class="literal">ENABLED=1</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Run <code class="literal">service stunnel4 start</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Then you will have a service that listens to port 19200 and forwards traffic to <code class="literal">proxy-v1-us-east-1.foundcluster.com:9243</code>.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_connecting"></a>Connecting<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/saas/stunneling-for-ssl.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Now we have a service that listens to port 19200 and tunnels traffic to Elasticsearch Service, while making sure the traffic is encrypted and that the certificate is valid.</p>
<p>However, if you try to send HTTP requests to <code class="literal">http://localhost:19200</code>, no information is forwarded about what deployment requests must be routed to.</p>
<p>Typically, endpoints are on the form <code class="literal">[deployment id]-[region].foundcluster.com</code>. The hostname is what specifies what deployment requests will be routed to.</p>
<p>A compatible hostname must be sent to Elasticsearch Service, but we still want to connect to <code class="literal">127.0.0.1</code>.</p>
<p>To do this, we can use <a href="https://github.com/elastic/hipio" class="ulink" target="_top">ip.es.io</a>. By connecting to <code class="literal">http://[your-deployment-id]-[region].127.0.0.1.ip.es.io:19200</code>, e.g. <code class="literal">http://7893883873a705aec69e2942901f20d7b1e28dec-us-east-1.127.0.0.1.ip.es.io</code>, the hostname will resolve to <code class="literal">127.0.0.1</code> and the hostname with the deployment ID will be sent to Elasticsearch Service.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service then has sufficient information to route requests to your endpoints.</p>
<p>While this hostname is not matching that of the SSL certificate (which matches *.foundcluster.com), it is stunnel that is terminating the SSL-connection. stunnel knows nothing about HTTP, and the client connecting to 19200 is completely unaware that traffic is being tunneled through SSL.</p>
<p>Note that stunnel will establish a new SSL-connection for every client that connects to it. It is important to use persistent connections, even though you are connecting to localhost. If not, you will be spending a lot of time establishing SSL-connections!</p>

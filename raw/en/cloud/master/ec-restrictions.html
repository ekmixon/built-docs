<p>Occasionally, we also publish information about <a class="xref" href="ec-restrictions.html#ec-known-problems" title="Known problems">Known problems</a> with our Elasticsearch Service or the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>To learn more about the features that are supported by Elasticsearch Service, see <a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service/subscriptions?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud Subscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Not all features of our Elasticsearch Service are available to Heroku users. Specifically, you cannot create additional deployments or use different deployment templates.</p>
<p>Generally, if a feature is shown as available in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>, you can use it.</p>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
LDAP and Active Directory realms are not supported. Alternatively, authentication protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect, or Kerberos can be used.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Client certificates, such as PKI certificates, are not supported.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You can&#8217;t set the Watcher webhook target to a deployment protected by traffic filters. Public webhooks such as Slack, PagerDuty, and email are not affected by this limitation.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elasticsearch Service are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not supported over <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="Private link traffic filters">private link connections</a>. Use the Java REST client instead, or connect over the public internet.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client does not work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and later that are hosted on Cloud. Transport client continues to work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and earlier. Note that the transport client was deprecated with version 7.0 and will be removed with 8.0.

Elasticsearch plugins, are not enabled by default for security purposes. Please reach out to support if you would like to enable Elasticsearch plugins support on your account.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some Elasticsearch plugins do not apply to Elasticsearch Service. For example, you won&#8217;t ever need to change discovery, as Elasticsearch Service handles how nodes discover one another.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins are no longer supported. This change does not affect the site plugins Elasticsearch Service might provide out of the box, such as Kopf or Head, since these site plugins are serviced by our proxies and not Elasticsearch itself.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins such as Kopf and Paramedic are no longer provided. We recommend that you use our <a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your cluster healthy">cluster performance metrics</a>, <a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your cluster healthy">X-Pack monitoring features</a> and Kibana&#8217;s (6.3+) <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.13/managing-indices.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Index Management UI</a> if you want more detailed information or perform index management actions.

There is a known problem affecting clusters with versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 due to <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">a bug in Elasticsearch</a>.
Although rare, this bug can prevent you from running plans. If this occurs we recommend that you retry the plan, and if that fails please contact support to get your plan through.
Because of this bug we recommend you to upgrade to version 7.8 and higher, where the problem has already been addressed.

<li class="listitem">
A known issue can prevent direct rolling upgrades from Elasticsearch version 5.6.10 to version 6.3.0. As a workaround, we have removed version 6.3.0 from the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> for new cluster deployments and for upgrading existing ones.

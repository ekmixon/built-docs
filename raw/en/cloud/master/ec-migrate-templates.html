<p>Starting in Elastic stack version 7.10, all deployments on Elasticsearch Service support hot, warm, and cold <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/data-tiers.html" class="ulink" target="_top">data tiers</a>. You no longer need to use a dedicated hot-warm architecture profile to manage your time series data, so this profile type is no longer available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When you create a deployment hosted on Elasticsearch Service, it uses one of the available solutions to preconfigure the Elastic Stack for your use case. If you have a deployment that is getting overwhelmed by the volume of incoming data or that contains logging data that doesn&#8217;t all need to be on fast storage, you can migrate your deployment to a hot-warm architecture by adding another data configuration. You use this added data configuration to store less frequently queried data.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_before_you_begin_9"></a>Before you begin<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/shared/ec-ce-migrate-deployment-templates.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>A hot-warm architecture works by initially creating new indices on a hot data configuration that provides fast, SSD-based storage where they can be accessed quickly. Over time, automatic index curation then moves these indices to warm nodes that provide slower, more affordable spinning-disk storage by changing their shard allocation.</p>
<p>Not all deployments can migrate to the hot-warm architecture template by adding another data configurations. To be able to migrate, you must originally have created the deployment using the Elastic Stack solution with the I/O optimized hardware profile. If you are not sure what you used, try the steps in this task to check if you can migrate.</p>
<p>If you cannot migrate to a hot-warm architecture directly, you can also create a new deployment using the hot-warm hardware profile and then restore your data from a snapshot there.</p>
<p>To learn more about how deployment templates and a hot-warm architecture work, see <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-profiles.html" title="What are hardware profiles?">What are hardware profiles?</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have migrated your deployment to a hot-warm architecture, you cannot change it back to a hot-only architecture without creating a new deployment and migrating your data.</p>

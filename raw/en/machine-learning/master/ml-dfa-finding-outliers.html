<p>Outlier detection is an analysis for identifying data points (outliers) whose
feature values are different from those of the normal data points in a
particular data set. Outliers may denote errors or unusual behavior.</p>
<p>We use unsupervised outlier detection which means there is no need to provide a
training data set to teach outlier detection to recognize outliers. Unsupervised
outlier detection uses various machine learning techniques to find which data points
are unusual compared to the majority of the data points.</p>
<p>You can create outlier detection data frame analytics jobs in Kibana or by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create data frame analytics jobs API</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="dfa-outlier-algorithms"></a>Outlier detection algorithms<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In the Elastic Stack, we use an ensemble of four different distance and density based
outlier detection methods:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
distance of K<sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor
</li>
<li class="listitem">
distance of K-nearest neighbors
</li>
<li class="listitem">
local outlier factor (<code class="literal">lof</code>)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
local distance-based outlier factor (<code class="literal">ldof</code>).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>By default, you don&#8217;t need to select the methods or
provide any parameters, but you can override the default behavior if you like.
The basic assumption of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>distance based methods</strong></span> is that normal data
points – in other words, points that are not outliers – have a lot of neighbors
nearby, because we expect that in a population the majority of the data points
have similar feature values, while the minority of the data points – the
outliers – have different feature values and will, therefore, be far away from
the normal points.</p>
<p>The distance of K<sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor method (<code class="literal">distance_kth_nn</code>) computes the
distance of the data point to its K<sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor where K is a small
number and usually independent of the total number of data points. The higher
this distance the more the data point is an outlier.</p>
<p>The distance of K-nearest neighbors method (<code class="literal">distance_knn</code>) calculates the
average distance of the data points to their nearest neighbors. Points with the
largest average distance will be the most outlying.</p>
<p>While the results of the distance based methods are easy to interpret, their
drawback is that they don&#8217;t take into account the density variations of a
data set. This is the point where <span class="strong strong"><strong>density based methods</strong></span> come into the
picture, they are used for mitigating this problem. These methods take into
account not only the distance of the points to their K nearest neighbors but
also the distance of these neighbors to their neighbors.</p>
<p>Based on this approach, a metric is computed called local outlier factor
(<code class="literal">lof</code>) for each data point. The higher the local outlier factor, the more
outlying is the data point.</p>
<p>The other density based method that outlier detection uses is the local
distance-based outlier factor (<code class="literal">ldof</code>). Ldof is a ratio of two measures: the
first computes the average distance of the data point to its K nearest
neighbors; the second computes the average of the pairwise distances of the
neighbors themselves. Again, the higher the value the more the data point is an
outlier.</p>
<p>As you can see, these four algorithms work differently, so they don&#8217;t always
agree on which points are outliers. By default, we use all these methods during
outlier detection, then normalize and combine their results and give every datapoint
in the index an outlier score. The outlier score ranges from 0 to 1, where the higher
number represents the chance that the data point is an outlier compared to the
other data points in the index.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Outlier detection is a batch analysis, it runs against your data
once. If new data comes into the index, you need to do the analysis again on the
altered data.</p>

<h4><a id="dfa-feature-influence"></a>Feature influence<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Besides the outlier score, another value is calculated during outlier detection:
the feature influence score. As we mentioned, there are multiple features of a
data point that are analyzed during outlier detection. An influential feature is a
feature of a data point that is responsible for the point being an outlier. The
value of feature influence provides a relative ranking of features by their
contribution to a point being an outlier. Therefore, while outlier score tells us
whether a data point is an outlier, feature influence shows which features make
the point an outlier. By doing this, this value provides context to help
understand more about the reasons for the data point being unusual and can drive
visualizations.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-outlier-detection-evaluate"></a>Outlier detection evaluation<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Using the data frame analytics features to gain insights from a data set is an
iterative process. You might need to experiment with different analyses,
parameters, and ways to transform data before you arrive at a result that
satisfies your use case. A valuable companion to this process is the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a>, which enables you to evaluate
the data frame analytics performance. It helps you understand error distributions and
identifies the points where the data frame analytics model performs well or less
trustworthily.</p>
<p>To evaluate the analysis with this API, you need to annotate your index that
contains the results of the analysis with a field that marks each document with
the ground truth. The evaluate data frame analytics API evaluates the performance of the
data frame analytics against this manually provided ground truth.</p>
<p>The outlier detection evaluation type is suitable for analyses which calculate a
probability that each data point in a data set is a member of a class or not. It
offers the following metrics to evaluate the model performance:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
confusion matrix
</li>
<li class="listitem">
precision
</li>
<li class="listitem">
recall
</li>
<li class="listitem">
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5><a id="ml-dfanalytics-confusion-matrix"></a>Confusion matrix<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>A confusion matrix provides four measures of how well the data frame analytics worked
on your data set:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
True positives (TP): Class members that the analysis identified as class
members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
True negatives (TN): Not class members that the analysis identified as not
class members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
False positives (FP): Not class members that the analysis misidentified as
class members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
False negatives (FN): Class members that the analysis misidentified as not
class members.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Although, the evaluate data frame analytics API can compute the confusion matrix out of the
analysis results, these results are not binary values (class member/not
class member), but a number between 0 and 1 (which called the outlier score in case
of outlier detection). This value captures how likely it is for a data
point to be a member of a certain class. It means that it is up to the user who
is evaluating the results to decide what is the threshold or cutoff point at
which the data point will be considered as a member of the given class. For
example, in the case of outlier detection the user can say that all the data points
with an outlier score higher than 0.5 will be considered as outliers.</p>
<p>To take this complexity into account, the evaluate data frame analytics API returns the confusion
matrix at different thresholds (by default, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75).</p>
<h5><a id="ml-dfanalytics-precision-recall"></a>Precision and recall<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>A confusion matrix is a useful measure, but it could be hard to compare the
results across the different algorithms. Precision and recall values
summarize the algorithm performance as a single number that makes it easier to
compare the evaluation results.</p>
<p>Precision shows how many of the data points that the algorithm identified as
class members were actually class members. It is the number of true positives
divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives (TP/(TP+FP)).</p>
<p>Recall answers a slightly different question. This value shows how many of the
data points that are actual class members were identified correctly as class
members. It is the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true
positives and false negatives (TP/(TP+FN)).</p>
<p>As was the case for the confusion matrix, you also need to define different
threshold levels for computing precision and recall.</p>
<h5><a id="ml-dfanalytics-roc"></a>Receiver operating characteristic curve<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot that represents the
performance of the binary classification process at different thresholds. It
compares the rate of true positives against the rate of false positives at the
different threshold levels to create the curve. From this plot, you can compute
the area under the curve (AUC) value, which is a number between 0 and 1. The
closer to 1, the better the algorithm performance.</p>
<p>The evaluate data frame analytics API can return the false positive rate (<code class="literal">fpr</code>) and the true
positive rate (<code class="literal">tpr</code>) at the different threshold levels, so you can visualize
the algorithm performance by using these values.</p>

<p>The data frame analytics job creates an index that contains the original data and

<p>The <code class="literal">ml.outlier</code> score is a value between 0 and 1. The larger the value, the

<p>In addition to an overall outlier score, each document is annotated with feature
influence values for each field. These values add up to 1 and indicate which
fields are the most important in deciding whether an entity is an outlier or

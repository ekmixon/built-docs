<p>Kibana automatically runs upgrade migrations when required.

Use <a class="xref" href="snapshot-repositories.html" title="Snapshot and Restore">Snapshot and Restore</a> to back up Kibana data by targeting the <code class="literal">.kibana*</code> indices.

Shut down all Kibana instances. Running more than one Kibana version against

<p>To identify the changes you need to make to upgrade, and to enable you to
perform an Elasticsearch rolling upgrade with no downtime, you must upgrade to
6.7 before you upgrade to 7.0.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of the upgrade process, refer to
<span class="strong strong"><strong><a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/master/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a></strong></span>.</p>
<h3><a id="upgrade-5x-earlier"></a>Upgrade from 5.x or earlier<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/master/docs/setup/upgrade.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch can read indices created in the previous major version. Before you upgrade
to 7.0.0, you must reindex or delete any indices created in 5.x or earlier.
For more information, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/master/upgrading-elastic-stack.html#oss-stack-upgrade" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a>.</p>
<p>When your reindex is complete, follow the <a class="xref" href="upgrade-standard.html" title="Standard upgrade">Standard upgrade</a>
instructions.</p>

<p>The recommended path is to upgrade to 6.8 before upgrading to 7.0. This makes it
easier to identify the required changes, and enables you to use the Upgrade
Assistant to prepare for your upgrade to 7.0.</p>
